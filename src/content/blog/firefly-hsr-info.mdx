## Information

Firefly is a new fire Destruction character in Honkai Star Rail that deals insane amount of Break Damage. She is a 5-star character and is a part of the new banner in version 2.3. Firefly is a great addition to the team and can be used in various situations. She is a great character to have in your team if you are looking for a fire DPS break character.

## Light Cones

### Whereabouts Should Dreams Rest
    - Increases the wearer’s Break Effect by 60%. When the wearer deals Break DMG to an enemy target, inflicts Routed on the enemy, lasting for 2 turn(s)
    - Targets afflicted with Routed receive 24.0% increased Break DMG from the wearer, and their SPD is lowered by 20%. Effects of the similar type cannot be stacked.
    - The best light cone for her. You can get this on the limited Light Cone banner.


### On the fall of an Aeon
    - Whenever the wearer attacks, their ATK is increased by 8% in this battle. This effect can stack up to 4 time(s).
    - After a character inflicts Weakness Break on an enemy, the wearer’s DMG increases by 12% for 2 turn(s).
    - The best alternative for her signature Light Cone. You can get this on the Herta's Store (including Superimpositions)

### Indelible Promise
    - Increases the wearer’s Break Effect by 28%. When the wearer uses their Ultimate, increases their CRIT Rate by 15%, lasting for 2 turn(s).
    - Not bad, but at least if gives 28% Break Effect.

## Ultimate and Skill

Once you activate her ultimate, she will turn into your personal kamen rider for many few turns. She goes "shing shing shing, boom!" on her skill and her basic attack is "slash shang shang!"
