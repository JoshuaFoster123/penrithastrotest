# Is ACS and AMI a disease of modern humans?

For a long time, it was thought that ACS or AMI's were a disease of modern humanisation. Changes in lifestyle and diet were thought to have lead to an increase of atherosclerosis. A study published in the Lancet [^1] , looked at whole body CT scans of 137 mummies from four different geographical locations. They found evidence in 47/137 mummies (34%) of existing atherosclerosis. 

In 1879, The pathologist Ludvig Hekton, concluded that myocardial infarction was caused by coronary thrombosis.
