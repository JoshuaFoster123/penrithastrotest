# What is Wellens syndrome?


Wellens syndrome is a clinical syndrome characterised by byphasic or deeply inverted T-waves in V2-V3 (may extend from V1-V6), in the clinical context of recent chest pain that has now **resolved**. This is very specific for critical Left Anterior Decending artery stenosis. Wellens syndrome is a pattern seen in a pain free state and may be obscured during episodes of chest pain.

# What causes Wellens syndrome?

Wellens is a reperfusion arrhythmia, meaning that clot lysis has occured and the deeply inverted or biphasic T-waves you see on the ECG indicate reperfusion. This is a significant example of why ECGs are important, even if the patient is pain free. Further it is a key example of why patients should have serial ECGs.

This ECG was taken on a male patient who had "epigastric" pain. The job was triaged as a 1C chestpain. The patient had taken his own GTN prior to arrival which had resolved his pain. He had a recent admission in ED for hyperkalaemia, and it was noted he was dicharged with ST-elevation in V1-V3. Not so much elevation anymore! 

# Clinical significance of Wellens syndrome

All patients presenting with wellens syndrome are at significant risk of reoccluding. Patients with wellens syndrome require invasive therapy in the cath lab and often do poorly with medical management. This cohort of patients are at risk of further MI, or arresting. 

Ask yourself, would you transmit this ECG? <br />Is wellens concerning considering its underlying pathology?

# Diagnostic criteria

The diagnostic criteria which is from [LITFL](https://litfl.com/wellens-syndrome-ecg-library/) and [This paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12442245/)

<Callout type="criteria" title="Wellens diagnostic criteria">
- Deeply inverted or biphasic T waves in V2-3 (may extend to V1-6)
- ECG pattern present in pain-free state
- Isoelectric or minimally-elevated ST segment (< 1mm)
- No precordial Q waves
- Preserved precordial R wave progression
- Recent history of angina
- Normal or slightly elevated serum cardiac markers
</ Callout>

# Is it type A or Type B?

The type is usually time dependant. Although the T-wave morphology can be dynamic, and chages over time. Ususally they will start out as type A and progress to type B over time. You can read more about the T-wave progression over time in this [LITFL article](https://litfl.com/wellens-syndrome-ecg-library/) written by some much smarter people than I.

# Why is knowing about wellens important?

Wellens syndrome is important to recognise because these patients have a significantly sinister pathology underlying their presentation. Patients with wellens are at significant risk of MI and Cardiac arrest. They benefit greatly from PCI, and should be transported to a cath capable hospital. 

Serial ECGs on patients are important, this is yet another example as to why.

<Callout type="question" title="Would you?"> 
With a little bit of knowledge, would you transmit an ECG for someone presenting with wellens syndrome?<br />Will you do an ECG on patients who present with 'Epigastric' pain or resolved chest pain?

</Callout>

I know I certainly would.
