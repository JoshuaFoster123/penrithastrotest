# What is a conduction abnormality?

Heart blocks and conduction abnormalities constitute a series of heart conditions effecting the cardiac conduction pathways. Heart blocks can be divided in to many categories; 1st degree heart block, 2nd degree (Mobitz I) heart block, 2nd degree (Mobitz II) heart block, and 3rd degree heart block, Left anterior and posterior fascicular blocks and right and left bundle branch blocks. 


# What is a heart block?

Heart blocks are a collection of conditions that encompass conduction delays/failure at or below the AV node, or the His-Purkinje system. Heart blocks can be categories into 4 main types. These are: 1st degree heart block, 2nd degree (Mobitz I) heart block, 2nd degree (Mobitz II) heart block, and 3rd degree heart block.

heart blocks range from non-life threatening to potentially life threatening. Heart blocks can cause severe bradycardia and haemodynamic compromise and may require advanced prehospital intervention. Often patients who present with 2nd degree and 3rd degree heart blocks end up with an implanted pacemaker. 

# 1st degree heart block

A first degree heart block is the result of slowed conduction through the AV node. Slowing of conduction can be due to changes in vagal tone or structural changes associated with damage or diseases effecting the AV node, or His-Purkinje system. 

In 1st degree heart block it takes longer for atrial conduction impulses (P wave) to pass through the conduction system. This results in a delay in ventricular contraction (QRS), and subsequent lengthening of the PR interval. The length of the P-R interval is of fixed duration. 

<Image src="https://img.penrith.education/content/1st-degree.avif" height="144" width="793" alt="1st degree heart block image"/>

The normal duration of the P-R interval is 0.12-0.20 seconds or 3-5 small boxes on the ECG. Although in 1st degree heart block, the P-R interval exceeds 0.20 seconds. 

1st degree heart blocks often require no intervention and are usually benign in isolation although may be present in underlying sinister aetiologies (MI, Myocarditis, drugs etc.). 

# 2nd degree heart block

Second degree heart blocks become a bit more complex. Mainly, there is two types of 2nd degree heart block, 2nd degree type 1 (Mobitz I) and 2nd degree type 2 (Mobitz 2). 

Further to this, type 2 can be classified as high-grade AV blocks, which often have a slow ventricular rate but are not considered a 3rd degree heart block due to some relationship between the P-waves and QRS complexes. They often have a conduction ratio, for example: 3:1 conduction - meaning 3 P-waves to 1 QRS conduction.

Unlike 1st degree heart blocks, 2nd degree heart blocks primarily occur at the level of the AV node although can occur below. Many causes for 2nd degree heart block exist, including pharmacological, pathological, and genetic conditions.

## 2nd degree type 1 (Mobitz I)

2nd degree type 1 is classified as a progressively slower conduction of atrial impulses through the AV node until and impulse is blocked. This results in a progressively lengthened P-R interval until a QRS is dropped. The P-P interval stays relatively the same and the R-R interval progressively shortens with each cycle.

</div>

2nd degree type 1 can often be seen in inferior or posterior infarct. This is because around 80% of Inferior MIs involve the RCA - Supplied by the Posterior descending artery. The AV node is supplied by the AV nodal artery, which is a branch of the RCA.  

other causes of 2nd degree type 1 are usually caused by reversible conduction block at the level of the AV node. Causes include drugs such as beta-blockers, digoxin, inferior MI, Myocarditis, Increased vagal tone and post cardiac surgery. 

Often type 1 can be asymptomatic, and will usually not require treatment if they remain asymptomatic. Symptomatic patients usually respond to conventional bradycardia treatments such as atropine. Pacing is rarely required. Concern should still exist as type 1 can still progress to type 2, or third degree heart block, especially in the context of MI.

## 2nd degree type 2 (Mobitz II)

2nd degree type 2 is classified as a fixed P-R interval with a dropped QRS. Unlike type 1, type 2 often occurs below the level of the AV node at the His-Purkinje system. Type 2 is more likely to occur due to structural damage to the conduction system, such as infarction, fibrosis, or necrosis. 

<Image src="https://img.penrith.education/content/mobitzII-normal.avif" width="1000" height="256" alt="2nd degree type 2  Image" />

Unlike type 1, type 2 is often due to a complete failure of the His-Purkinje system to conduct atrial impulses. 

Type 2 heart blocks often have no pattern but there can be a relationship between p-waves and QRS complexes. I.E a 2:1 or 3:1 block. A heart block is considered a High-grade AV block when the P-QRS ratio is >3:1.

</Callout>

Causes of type 2 heart block often include anterior MI, inflammatory conditions (Myocarditis, Rheumatic fever), autoimmune diseases, hyperkalaemia, or drugs such as beta-blockers or CCBs. 

Type 2 heart block has a larger significance over type 1, as type 2 often presents with haemodynamic compromise, bradycardia and can often progress to 3rd degree heart block. Type 2 heart blocks ultimately require permanent pacemaker insertion. 

Type 2 rhythms often require pacing and can be resistant to pharmacological solutions. There is a primary pacemaker issue, as the AV node is diseased. This is important to note as haemodynamic compromise can be significant. There is increased risk of asystole, Ventricular tachycardia or sudden cardiac death in these patients. 

# 3rd degree heart block

A 3rd degree heart block is the final progression of AV nodal disease and is essentially the end point of 2nd degree type 1 and 2. AV nodal conduction is completely absent and no atrial impulses are conducted. Cardiac output is maintained by junctional or ventricular escape rhythms. Often patients present with syncope if prolonged ventricular stand still occurs, or due to haemodynamic compromise. 

3rd degree heart block is characterised by complete disconnect between the atria and ventricles, this results in disassociation of the P waves and QRS. 3rd degree heart blocks will present with severe bradycardia, as the intrinsic rate of the ventricle tissue is 20-40bpm. Junctional tissue has an intrinsic rate of 40-60bpm. 

3rd degree heart block can be caused by the same causes of type 1 and 2 although  these are the most important aetiologies: Myocardial infarction, often inferior, posterior, anterior or septal infarcts. Drugs, such as Beta-blockers, CCBs, or digoxin. Degeneration of the conduction system causing trifascicular block (3rd degree AV block + RBBB + LAFB).


These patients often do not respond to pharmacological intervention, although some presentations may respond to atropine or adrenaline. Often transcutaneous/transvenous pacing is required as these patients are at extreme risk of cardiac/ventricular standstill, are bradycardic and are often haemodynamically compromised. Most patients in 3rd degree heart block will have a permanent pacemaker inserted, unless there is an underlying reversible cause.

<Callout type="warning" title="Don't sleep on it">
All patients who present with a heart block should be transported to a tertiary hospital with cardiac capabilities. Early activation of advanced clinical resources must be considered. These patients may present haemodynamically stable initially, although have a significant risk of deterioration. Delay should only be for meaningful intervention and rapid transportation could be life saving, consider meeting higher clinical resources enroute.

# Bundle branch blocks and other conduction abnormalities

Bundle branch blocks are classified as left and right bundle branch blocks. Bundle branch blocks are a set of conditions that result in the non-conduction of impulses down either the left or right bundle branch. This results in delayed conduction of impulses to either the left or right ventricle, due to conduction being passed through the septum. This results in wide and bizarre looking QRS complexes.

## Left bundle branch block

In a left bundle branch block (LBBB) conduction down the left bundle branch is blocked, and thus on cardiac impulses are conducted down the right bundle branch. This results in depolarisation of the right ventricle first, and delayed conduction occurs through the septum to the left ventricle. This results in a wide and deep S wave in the right precordial leads (V1-V3). The normal conduction time of the QRS is \<.12 seconds, although in a LBBB the QRS duration is >.12 seconds.

<Callout type="criteria" title="LBBB Criteria">
    - QRS duration ≥ 120ms
    - Dominant S wave in V1
    - Broad monophasic R wave in lateral leads (I, aVL, V5-6)
    - Absence of Q waves in lateral leads
    - Prolonged R wave peak time > 60ms in leads V5-6
</Callout>

## Right bundle branch block

The right bundle branch block (RBBB) is the inverse of the LBBB. Conduction is passed from the left ventricle to the right ventricle, through the septum. This results in delayed R waves in V1-V3, and often will result in a RSR pattern with presence of wide slurred S waves in 1, aVL, V5-V6. 

The image below demonstrates the RSR pattern in V2-3, wide slurred S waves in V5-V6.
